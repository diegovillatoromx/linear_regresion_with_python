# Linear regresion with python

## Project Overview

At the intersection of cutting-edge innovation and the magnetic allure of the English Premier League (EPL), a Machine Learning Engineering odyssey unfolds. With a global audience of 12 million per match, the EPL beckons as a canvas for transformative insights through Analytics and Artificial Intelligence (AI). In this symphony of data and soccer, Machine Learning Engineers unite algorithms and strategies, crafting predictive models to elevate player analysis, strategic decisions, and risk management. Anchored by the stalwart Regression technique, particularly Linear Regression, our expedition navigates uncharted territories to forecast EPL soccer scores. Seamlessly weaving business insight, our focus pivots to the technical arena. Here, we dissect methodologies, architect pipelines, and refine models, orchestrating an exquisite interplay of data, algorithms, and ingenuity. As the unpredictable spirit of soccer converges with quantifiable patterns, Machine Learning Engineering emerges as both the brushstroke and canvas of this captivating journey.

## Approach

This project starts with a real-life example for regression analysis, with an introduction to simple and multiple linear regression. Building the statistical foundation for the regression, it gives you a brief idea of the formula of regression. With this background, the first regression model in python is built. Going through the interpolation and extrapolation also explains errors in regression and Lurking variables. The point estimators of mean and variance and distributions of underlying parameters are also discussed. The coefficient of determination is also known, and R squared is briefly explained. The project ends with diagnostics and remedial measures for regression with a practical explanation. 

## Tech Stack

* Language: Python
* Libraries: pandas, statsmodel, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn, scipy

## Data Description

The dataset used is the soccer player dataset. It has information about various players from different clubs, and it provides data over ten features with score as the target variable.
